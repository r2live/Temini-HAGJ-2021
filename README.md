# Temini-HAGJ-2021

This is the repository for the project me and my team worked on for Historically Accurate Game Jam 4, which ran from June 18 2021 to June 27 2021.

Temini is a 2D platformer that depicts a struggle between the sun god and moon goddess of Aztec mythology - Huitzilopochtli and Coyolxauhqui respectively. The moon goddess has captured the sun god and imprisoned him in her temple, and it's up to the player to guide the sun god out of the temple to save the world from eternal night.

This project was developed in Unity using the C# language.
